# UpdateCLI Manifests

This directory contains UpdateCLI manifest files for automated dependency updates.

## Current Status

Currently empty. The jenkins-lts.yaml manifest was removed after migrating to
quickstart-tutorials GHCR images (#953), as Jenkins LTS version is now managed upstream.

## Adding New Manifests

To track Docker or other versions, add UpdateCLI manifest files here.
See https://www.updatecli.io/ for documentation.
